#### Programming: Python 
#### Libraries/Tools:
* **Pandas** - Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, 
  cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
* **Streamlit** -  Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short     time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
* **Web3.py** - This module allows for the interaction of Ethereum and to help with sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, reading block data,   and a variety of other use cases.
* **Remix** - This website acts as a workspace where you can write, compile, deploy, and interact with your solidity code.
* **Ganache** - Ganache is a private Ethereum blockchain environment that allows to you emulate the Ethereum blockchain so that you can interact with smart       contracts in your own private blockchain.
* **Metamask** - MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.
* **VS Code** - Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows,     Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
